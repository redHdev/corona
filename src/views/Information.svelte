      <h3>ðŸ‘‰ Coronavirus & COVID-19</h3>
      <p>
        Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans,
        several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to
        more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
        Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p>
        COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus
        and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="sars_cov_diff">
      <col class="col">
      <h3>ðŸ‘‰ Difference with SARS-COV-2</h3>
      <p>
        The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
        in
        2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.
      </p>
      <p>
        SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in
        the
        world since 2003.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="symptoms">
      <col class="col">
      <h3>ðŸ‘‰ Symptoms</h3>
      <p>
        The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. These symptoms
        are
        usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel
        unwell.
        Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6
        people
        who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
        underlying
        medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious
        illness.<br/>
        People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

      <h3>ðŸ‘‰ Spreading</h3>
      <p>
        People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through
        small
        droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets
        land
        on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or
        surfaces,
        then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales
        droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="risk">
      <col class="col">
      <h3>ðŸ‘‰ Risk</h3>
      <p>
        The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living
        in, or
        visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking
        vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions
        on
        travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching
        or
        spreading COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p>
        COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other
        countries.
        Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Itâ€™s important to be aware of the situation where you are or
        intend
        to go.

      <h3>ðŸ‘‰ Protection</h3>
      <p>
        Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in
        China
        and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is
        unpredictable so check regularly for the latest and authentic news.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
          Washing
          your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. When
          someone
          coughs or sneezes, they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
          are
          too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the
          disease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,
          hands
          can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you
          sick.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and
          nose
          with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Droplets
          spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as
          cold,
          flu and COVID-19.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and
          call
          in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. National and local authorities will have the
          most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care
          provider
          to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of
          viruses
          and other infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If
          possible, avoid traveling to places â€“ especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung
          disease. You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
        </li>
      </ul>
